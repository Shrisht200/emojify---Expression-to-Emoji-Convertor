##Emojify## - Expression to Emoji Converter

Emojify-  is an AI-powered tool that analyzes facial expressions in images and provides a corresponding emoji that matches the emotion expressed in the photo. It uses facial recognition and emotion detection to interpret the image and generate an appropriate emoji.

## Features

- **Facial Expression Recognition:** Detects emotions in images such as happiness, sadness, surprise, etc.
- **Emoji Mapping:** Maps recognized emotions to relevant emojis (e.g., 😊 for happiness, 😢 for sadness).
- **Supports Various Emotions:** Includes a wide range of emojis for different facial expressions.
- **Simple Interface:** Easy to use, works with images and provides an instant emoji response.

## Installation

To install **Emojify**, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Using pip

You can install **Emojify** via pip:

```bash
pip install emojify
```

### From Source

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone 
cd emojify
```

2. Install the required dependencies:



## Usage

### Basic Usage

To analyze a facial expression from an image and get the corresponding emoji, use the following code:

```python
from emojify import get_emoji_from_expression

# Path to your image file
image_path = "path_to_your_image.jpg"

# Get the corresponding emoji
emoji = get_emoji_from_expression(image_path)
print(emoji)
```

### Example Output:

If the detected expression is happy:

```text
😊
```

If the detected expression is sad:

```text
😢
```

### Command Line Usage

You can also use **Emojify** from the command line. Run the following command to pass an image and get the emoji result:

```bash
python emojify.py "path_to_your_image.jpg"
```

### Supported Emotions and Corresponding Emojis

- **Happy:** 😊
- **Sad:** 😢
- **Surprised:** 😲
- **Angry:** 😡
- **Confused:** 😕
- **Neutral:** 😐
- **Disgusted:** 🤢
- **Fearful:** 😨

The system detects the facial expressions in the image and selects the most appropriate emoji from the list above.

## Customization

You can customize the emoji mapping or the emotion detection logic if needed. The `get_emoji_from_expression` function can be modified to include additional emotions or to use a custom mapping for specific use cases.

### Example: Custom Mapping

To add custom emoji mappings, you can edit the expression-to-emoji dictionary.

```python
# Define custom emoji mappings
custom_emoji_map = {
    "joyful": "😂",
    "sad": "😔",
    "excited": "🤩",
    "tired": "😴"
}

# Use the custom emoji mapping
emoji = get_emoji_from_expression(image_path, emoji_map=custom_emoji_map)
print(emoji)
```

## How It Works

1. **Facial Expression Recognition:** The system uses a pre-trained deep learning model to detect key facial features and classify emotions based on the facial expressions in the image.
2. **Emotion-to-Emoji Mapping:** Once the emotion is recognized, the system maps it to a corresponding emoji using a predefined or custom mapping.

### Dependencies

- **OpenCV**: For image processing and facial recognition.
- **TensorFlow or PyTorch**: For emotion detection using a neural network.
- **NumPy**: For image manipulation and data handling.
